Ruthless

Little
Artoo
stands
ridged
in
the
middle
of
the

Threepio
runs
awkwardly
toward
the
tiny

from
a
large

at

I

A
new

Oh
no
Not
at
a
time
like
this
How
much
longer
The
muted
sounds
of
grinding
and
crushing
get
louder
until
a
dozen
Imperial
stormtroopers
wearing
spookylooking
armor
enter
the
passageway
They
arrange
themselves
geometrically
their
movements
synchronized
as
they
move
stealthily
through
the
unusually
wide
corridor
Threepio
grabs
his
little
partner
and
struggles
to
drag
him
into
the
shadows
of
an
emergency
ventilator
system
Hard
and
weary
the
troops
advance

their
glowing
laser
swords
held
at
ready
Suddenly
directly
in
back
of
the
stormtroopers
about
ten
feet
away
the
imposing
young
Jedi
Deak
Starkiller
steps
from
behind
the
open
hatch
His
chrome
laser
pistol
still
rests
in
its
holster
but
his
laser
sword
sparks
to
life
with
a
sharp
hum
One
of
the
troopers
senses
his
presence
and
turns
freezing
momentarily
The
rest
of
the
troops
turn
a
second
later
almost
as
a
reflex
action
A
slow
grim
smile
creeps
across
Deaks
face
as
the
troops
realize
they
are
outmatched

to
step
forward
and
raise
their

Deak
is
quicker
In
one
amazing
movement
he
spins
around
replacing
his
laser
sword
to
his
belt
and
draws
his
deadly
laser
pistol
blasting
out
four
shots
that
rip
through
the
soldiers
In
a
few
moments
the
entire
passageway
blazes
with
laser
fire
Laser
bolts
ricochet
in
wild
random
patterns
creating
small
explosions
and
finally
a
small
hole
in
the
wall
which
sucks
debris
and
stormtroopers
into
space
until
finally
it
is
plugged
by
a
large
supply
canister
Artoo
and
Threepio
are
plummeted
by
loose
equipment
and
debris
Threepio
attempts
to
cover
his
head
Artoo
pulls
a
grate
off
the
vent
system
and
starts
to
enter
the
dark
shaft
Threepio
clings
to
a
side
rail
for
dear
life
as
debris
and
laser
bolts
fly
past
him
Artoo
beeps
to
his
terrified
companion
THREEPIO
No
more

No

Artoo
disappears
down
the
ominous
shaft
He
leaves
his

with
a
few
parting
whistles

a
powerful
magnetic

shoots
out

a

laser

held
high
over
his

The

Suspended
at

level

about
ten
feet
in
front
of
Luke
a
chrome
baseball
covered
with
antenna
hovers
slowly
in
a
wide
arc
The
ball
floats
to
one
side
of
the
youth
then
to
the
other
Suddenly
it
makes
a
lightning
swift
lunge
and
stops
within
a
few
feet
of
Lukes
face
Luke
doesnt
move
and
the
ball
backs
off
It
slowly
moves
behind
the
boy
then
makes
another
quick
lunge
this
time
emitting
a
blood
red
laser
beam
as
it
attacks
Luke
sparks
to
life
With
one
amazingly
swift
move
he
turns
and
swings
his
laser
sword
deflecting
the
beam
and
losing
his
balance
tumbles
to
the
desert
floor
The
ball
shoots
straight
up
in
the
air
about
twenty
feet
then
drops
like
a
rock
firing
a
second
laser
bolt
which
hits
the
youth
square
on
the
seat
of
his
pants
Luke
lets
out
a
painful
yell
and
attempts
to
scramble
to
his
feet
but
is
hit
several
more
times
before
he
manages
to
regain
his
balance
and
deflect
the
bolts
The
ball
ceases
firing
and
moves
back
to
its
original
position
Luke
raises
his
hand
signaling
enough
for
one
day
He
wearily
picks
up
his
things
including
the
chrome
ball
then
turns
and
waves
to
the
small
group
on
the
ridge
The

run
down
to

OWEN
Your
father
is
getting
very
old
I
fear
he
needs
your
help
more
than
your
brother
does
and
much
more
depends
on
him
succeeding
If
he
at
last
has
asked
for
the
Kiber
Crystal
his
powers
must
be
very
weak
It
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
have
loose
in
the

you
need
him
for
you

Youre

I
know
youd
rather
carve
a

stone

work
on
your

trained
seven

its
clear
that
you
are

not

you

the
way
about

wisdom
far
beyond

OWEN
You
must
learn
to
use
such
strength
and
wits
as
you
have
Your
father
has
need
of
the
Kiber

The
decision
is
yours
I
cannot
bear
this
burden
for
you
my
duty
is

unconcealed

Without

you
the
way
will
be
difficult
and
chances
of
your
reaching
your

slim
Dont
try
it

you
think
you
are
going

fail
The
power

grown

if

all
hope
would
be
lost

Somehow
you
will
have
to
manage

find
transport
in

EISLEY
and
once
you
do
the

What
was
Deak
thinking
of
to
place
such
an
impossible
task
before
his
brother
The
door
opens
and
Luke
enters
collapsing
in
a
large
overstuffed
chair
near
a
potbelly
thermalheater
which
dominates
the

A
warm
friendly
glow
radiates
from
a
tiny
portal
in
front
of
the
heater
Lukes
gaze
is
fixed
on
the
red
embers
but
his
eyes
are
lit
as
if
by
a
greater
fire
from

Owen

Beru
talk
quietly

on

A

Deak
told
it

told

LUKE
CONTD
In
another
time
long
before
the
Empire
and
before
the
Republic
had
been
formed
a
holy
man
called
the
Skywalker
became
aware
of
a
powerful
energy
field
which
he
believed
influenced
the
destiny
of
all
living
creatures
BIGGS
The
FORCE
OF
OTHERS
LUKE
Yes
and
after
much
study
he
was
able
to
know
the
force
and
it
communicated
with
him
He
came
to
see
things
in
a
new
way
His
aura
and
powers
grew
very
strong
The
Skywalker
brought
a
new
life
to
the
people
of
his
system
and
became
one
of
the
founders
of
the
Republic
Galactica
WINDY
The
FORCE
OF
OTHERS
talked
to
him
LUKE
In
a
manner
different
from
the
way
we
talk
As
you
know
the
FORCE
OF
OTHERS
has
two
halves
Ashla
the
good
and
Bogan
the
paraforce
or
evil
part
Fortunately
Skywalker
came
to
know
the
good
half
and
was
able
to
resist
the
paraforce
but
he
realized
that
if
he
taught
others
the
way
of
the
Ashla
some
with
less
strength
might
come
to
know
Bogan
the
dark
side
and
bring
unthinkable
suffering
to
the
Universe
For
this
reason
the
Skywalker
entrusted
the
secret
of
THE
FORCE
only
to
his
twelve
children
and
they
in
turn
passed
on
the
knowledge
only
to
their
children
who
became
known
as
the
Jedi
Bendu
of
the
Ashla
the
servants
of
the
force
For
thousands
of
years
they
brought
peace
and
justice
to
the
galaxy
At
one
time
there
were
several
hundred
Jedi
families
but
now
there
are
only
two
or
three
WINDY
What
happened
to
them
LUKE
As
the
Republic
spread
throughout
the
galaxy
encompassing
over
a
million
worlds
the
GREAT
SENATE
grew
to
such
overwhelming
proportions
that
it
no
longer
responded
to
the
needs
of
its
citizens
After
a
series
of
assassinations
and
elaborately
rigged
elections
the
Great
Senate
became
secretly
controlled
by
the
Power
and
Transport
guilds
When
the
Jedi
discovered
the
conspiracy
and
attempted
to
purge
the
Senate
they
were
denounced
as
traitors
Several
Jedi
allowed
themselves
to
be
tried
and
executed
but
most
of
them
fled
into
the
Outland
systems
and
tried
to
tell
people
of
the
conspiracy
But
the
elders
chose
to
remain
behind
and
the
Great
Senate
diverted
them
by
creating
civil
disorder
The
Senate
secretly
instigated
race
wars
and
aided
antigovernment
terrorists
They
slowed
down
the
system
of
justice
which
caused
the
crime
rate
to
rise
to
the
point
where
a
totally
controlled
and
oppressive
police
state
was
welcomed
by
the
systems
The
Empire
was
born
The
systems
were
exploited
by
a
new
economic
policy
which
raised
the
cost
of
power
and
transport
to
unbelievable
heights
Many
worlds
were
destroyed
this
way
Many
people
starved
BIGGS
Why
didnt
the
FORCE
OF
OTHERS
help
the
Jedi
to
put
things
right
LUKE
Because
a
terrible
thing
happened
During
one
of
his
lessons
a
young
PADAWANJEDI
a
boy
named
Darklighter
came
to
know
the
evil
half
of
the
force
and
fell
victim
to
the
spell
of
the
dreaded
Bogan
He
ran
away
from
his
instructor
and
taught
the
evil
ways
of
the
Bogan
Force
to
a
clan
of
Sith
pirates
who
then
spread
untold
misery
throughout
the
systems
They
became
the
personal
bodyguards
of
the
Emperor
The
Jedi
were
hunted
down
by
these
deadly
Sith
knights
With
every
Jedi
death
contact
with
the
Ashla
grows
weaker
and
the
force
of
the
Bogan
grows
more
powerful
WINDY
Where
are
the
Jedi
now
LUKE
Theyre
hidden
but
many
are
still
fighting
to
free
the

then
goes
to

He
lovingly
roughs
up
the

and
starts
to
give
Leia
a
kiss
but
thinks
better
of
it
and
gives
her
a
short
polite
hug
before
retreating
to

Leia
is
greatly
disappointed
OWEN

Luke
pops
open
the

speeder
but
before
he
can
get
in
Leia
runs
up
and
gives
him
a

Luke
is
surprised
and
embarrassed
Beru
and
Owen
smile
as
Leia
rushes
back
into
the
house
Luke
settles
into
the
speeder
and
it
starts
with
a
crack
and
loud
whine
Everyone
waves
as
the
speeder
roars
out
of

into
the
desolate
Utapau

glides
effortlessly
through
the
treacherous
rock
canyons
and
out
onto
the
awesome
dune

The
vibrations
of
the

causes
Artoos
outer
shell
to
rattle
a
rhythmic
little
tune
LUKE
How
long
were
you
with
my
brother
THREEPIO
I
had
the
pleasure
of
serving
Master
Deak
for
over
three
years
my
counterpart
was
with
him
a
bit
longer
Artoo
chatters
to
his
bronze
interpreter
THREEPIO
CONTD
Three
years
eight
months
Master
Deak
is
a
man
above
men
You
should
be
proud
of
him
indeed
you
should
sir
Im
only
a
droid
and
not
much
more
than
an
interpreter
and
not
very
good
at
poetry
if
you
take
my
meaning

not
at
making
it
up
anyway
So
I
cant
tell
you
what
hes
really
like
But
a
great
man
he
is
Strongwith
great
skillI
hope
hes
not
in
perilwhat
a
dilemma
Sometimes
the
logic
of
human
relations
escapes
me
Luke
thinks
about
this
for
a
few
moments
then
rather
reluctantly
almost
afraid
he
asks
a
second
question
LUKE
Have
you
ever
met
my
father
THREEPIO
No
Im
afraid
not
sir
I
couldnt
even
tell
you
what
he
looks
like
Hes
an
elusive
one
More
of
a
myth
than
a
man
if
I
may
say
so
sirBut
Master
Deak
always
spoke
of
him
with
great
respect
Luke
seems
a
little
disappointed
with
Threepios
answer

EXT
DUNE

The
small
speeder
sits
at
the
bottom
of
a
huge
sand
dune
Luke
with
his
extremely
longbarreled
laser
rifle
slung
over
his
shoulder
makes
his
way
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
He
studies
the
landscape
with
his
electrobinoculars
until
he
spots
a
small
dust
twister
speeding
toward
them
He
quickly
slides
back
down
the
dune
to
where
Threepio
is
lifting
Artoo
out
of
the
speeder
The
stubby
little
robot
struts
around
stretching
his
joints
between
irritated
whistles
LUKE

there

The

stops
on
a
bluff
overlooking
the

at
MOS
EISLEY
It
is
a
haphazard
array
of
low
gray
concrete
structures
and
semidomes
A
harsh
gale
blows
across
the
bleak
canyon
floor
and
batters
Luke
as
he
lowers
his
sand
goggles
and
walks
to
the
edge
of
the
craggy
bluff
A
leaden
sky
presses
down
on
the
large
settlement
which
seems
to
be
losing
a
neverending
battle
against
the
shifting
sands
Something
in
the
distance
catches
his
eye
and
he
instinctively
grabs
his
electrobinoculars
He
follows
a
sinisterblack
tusken

One

weird

exotic

Boma
named
OEETA
The
Boma
is
a
furcovered
creature
about
five
feet
high
and
looks
like
a
cross
between
a

is
obvious
from

embraces
Oeeta

brings
them

a

of

would
be
worth
more

you
could

in

Artoo
begins
to
beep

Threepio
puts
his
bronze
hand
over
his

Luke
thinks
about
this
for
a

What
if
I
were
to
pay
you

my

gave
you
the

He
is

turns

Hundreds

somewhat

duck

Suddenly

They
start

the

Wookiee
stops
and
howls
something
at
Han
The

talks
to
the

eventually
calms
him
down

a
huge

blocks
out

Deak
lying
by

In

His
laser
bolt
passes
through
the
huge
creature
and
explodes
against
a
far
wall
The
light
from

reveals
a
little
more

the

which
is
something
like
a
cross
between
a
huge
spider

giant
squid
Han
has
blindfolded
Chewbacca
and
attempts
to
lead
the
Wookiee
carrying
Deak
around
the
terrifying
Dai
Noga
They
edge
their
way
along
the
corridor
wall
as
Luke
fires
a
second
blast
at
the
slime
The
Dai
Noga
lets
out
with
a
horrible
moan
and
lumbers
towards
Luke
with
a
new
vigor
Luke
backs
away
firing
as
he
goes
Han

Chewbacca
make
it

watch

move

HAN
Were

He
fires
a
shot
at
the
monster
but
it
continues
after
Luke
LUKE
Shoot

Han
fires
again
this
time
above
the
creature
knocking
rocks

debris
on

him
He
turns

to
creep
around

spiderlike
monster
lets
out

leaps

Chewbacca
has
worked

fires

The
noise

echoes
relentlessly

Luke
simply
shakes

Luke

he
winds
up
in
a
large

full
of

Han
is
already
stumbling
around

He
draws

ricochets
wildly
around

Both

dive
for

almost

Luke
climbs
out
of

garbage
with
a
rather
grim
look
on
his
face
LUKE
Im
glad
to
see
the

no

would
you
put

Ill
leave

Before

the

Luke
slumps
over

quietly
Suddenly
he
remembers
the

in

He
takes
off
his

fumbles

But
his

hangs
half
out

A

high
insectlike
creature
scoots
down
a
branch
and
onto
the
back
of
the
dormant

The
insect
lets
out
a
chilling
hissing
sound
and
a
slimy
tube
emerges
from
its
hairy
mouth
waking

He
opens
his
eyes
but
doesnt
move
He
is
immediately
aware

Suddenly
with
one
quick
blow
he
knocks
the
creature
against

robot
out

predicament
and
places
him
securely
on

then
attaches
a
thin
cable
from
his
utility
belt
to
the

slides
to

Yeah
I

so
Im
going

need
some
help

Deak
down
from
there
Chewbacca
emerges
from
the
dense

and
tells
Han
something
He
tells
Chewbacca
to
climb
the
tree
and
get
Deak

He
says

the

around

The

follows
a
short
distance

begins
to
bounce
about
as
it
nears
the

Chewbacca
in
the

away
at
the

One

the

Chewbacca

dives
past

approaches
the

LUKE

The

skims
the
surface
of
the
Death
Star
blasting
a
thin
path
across
its
surface
As
they
pass
the

both
Threepio

Antilles
get
several
shots
directly
down
the

EXT
BATTLE
The
small
craft
veers
sharply
away
from
the
Death
Star
as
ominous
rumbles
and
explosions
can
be
heard
coming
from
within
the
huge
super
fortress
The
rebel
ship
speeds
past
the
small
lifepod
from
the
pirate
ship
as
it
slowly
drifts
toward
the
green
calm
of
Yavins
Fourth
Moon
Han
Montross
and
the
furry
Chewbacca
watch
the
ominous
fortress
grow
smaller
as
they
drift
further
and
further
away
Suddenly
a
great
flash
replaces
the
fortress
and
rubble
streaks
past
the
lifepod
and
lone
rebel
starship
Several
giant
explosions
follow
until
there
is
only
a
smoke
cloud
where

runs
up

The

once
again
spark
fear
in
the

of
the

knights
but
not
before
his

put
to
many

most
daring
of

was
the
